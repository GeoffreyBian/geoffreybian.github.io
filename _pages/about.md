I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I am enthusiastic about the potential of computing in software development and I am determined to make a meaningful impact in the digital landscape. 

`Personal Pursuits:`
My current technical interest spans Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing. Currently, I am working on a machine learning project to provide stock prediction services. 

`Vision for the Future:` 
Looking ahead, my vision for the future revolves around continuous learning in full stack development. I aspire to deepen my understanding in crafting robust and scalable solutions that power the digital landscape. 

`Extracurricular Activities:`
I am the captain of the Ice-o-topes intramural hockey team at UBC. I have played hockey since I was 5 years old and continue to hold a great passion for the sport. My commitments extend to electric vehicles. As a member of the UBC Formula Electric team, I contribute to the development of boards on the electrical team. This involves designing hardware solutions to support our electric vehicle, Quadruna, in competing for the Formula SAE Electric competition. This experience not only sharpens my technical skills but also instills a sense of teamwork and innovation. Furthermore, in my spare time, I pursue photography capturing diverse landscapes and nature. Some of my work can be found at [Dynamiquo](https://www.instagram.com/geothought/) on Instagram.
